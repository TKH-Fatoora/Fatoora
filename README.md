<b>Summary:</b>

Have you ever forgotten what you actually spent throughout your day and felt that your money is vanishing quickly? Well,
this is exactly why you need to start using Fatoora. Fatoora is a money managing website, where the user inputs every
purchase done throughout the day by classifying where the money was actually deducted through a certain account such
as a Debit Card or a Prepaid Account, and classifies their purchase under certain categories ranging from Health,
Transportation, Beauty, or even Social Life. One of the features of Fatoora is that it eases to the user a summary of
everything they spent, through a Dashboard page, which shows the statistics of the most and least category type spent
on, as well as showing which type of account your money has been deducted from the most. Lastly, to access Fatoora,
there are three different accounts having different privileges for certain use. To start with, A normal user has access to
add every transaction using a certain different account that occurred throughout the day with them. The Admin User can
view all the users that've recorded their transactions, as well as set privileges for all users, and delete or view the statistics
of the users. Not to mention, An employee account exists, which is responsible for viewing the users' replies from the
Contact Us section. In this report, we will be focusing on the front and backend development, security measures,
penetration testing activities taken to launch Fatooraâ€™s website. In each section, we will be discussing a phase of the
software development life cycle.
